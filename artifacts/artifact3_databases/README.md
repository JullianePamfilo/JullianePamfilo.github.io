# Artifact 3: Databases

## Artifact Overview
This artifact is an enhanced Python-based CRUD application developed using data from the Austin Animal Center. The application performs create, read, update, and delete operations on animal shelter records.

I selected this artifact because it demonstrates my ability to work with data persistence, database interaction, and secure data handling practices.

## Original Implementation
The original version of the application implemented basic CRUD functionality but had limited validation, minimal error handling, and fewer safeguards against invalid data operations.

## Enhancements Made
For the enhanced version, I focused on improving data integrity, reliability, and maintainability:

- Added robust input validation to prevent invalid or inconsistent data entries
- Improved error handling to ensure graceful failure and clearer user feedback
- Refactored the code to improve readability and logical flow
- Strengthened data handling practices to reflect real-world database interaction standards

These enhancements ensure the application behaves predictably and securely when managing persistent data.

## Skills Demonstrated
- Database design and CRUD operations
- Data validation and integrity enforcement
- Secure coding practices
- Python programming and refactoring
- Professional documentation of database-driven applications

## Course Outcomes Addressed
This artifact demonstrates the following CS 499 course outcomes:

- Design and implement database-driven applications
- Apply secure coding and data validation best practices
- Develop maintainable and reliable data management solutions
- Communicate technical processes clearly through documentation

## Reflection
Enhancing this artifact strengthened my understanding of the importance of data validation and security in database applications. It highlighted how even small improvements in validation and error handling can significantly increase system reliability and trustworthiness.
