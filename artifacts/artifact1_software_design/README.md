# Artifact 1: Software Design and Engineering

## Artifact Overview
This artifact represents my work in software design and engineering and is an enhanced version of the Project Two Dashboard originally developed in CS 340: Client/Server Development. The project is implemented as an interactive data dashboard that visualizes and filters animal shelter data from the Austin Animal Center.

I selected this artifact because it demonstrates my ability to design and engineer a complete software system that integrates data processing, visualization, and user interaction while following sound software engineering principles.

## Original Implementation
In its original form, the dashboard provided basic filtering and visualization of data pulled from a database. While functional, the initial version had limited modularity, minimal documentation, and fewer considerations for scalability, maintainability, and user experience.

## Enhancements Made
For the enhancement, I focused on improving the overall software design and architecture:

- Refactored the code to improve modularity and separation of concerns
- Improved readability and maintainability through clearer structure and naming conventions
- Enhanced data flow between the backend and the visualization components
- Improved user interaction by refining filtering logic and visual presentation
- Added clearer documentation to explain system behavior and design decisions

These enhancements demonstrate my ability to evaluate an existing system and apply software engineering best practices to improve its quality.

## Skills Demonstrated
- Software architecture and system design
- Modular and maintainable code development
- Data visualization and user-centered design
- Integration of backend data processing with frontend components
- Professional documentation practices

## Course Outcomes Addressed
This artifact demonstrates the following CS 499 course outcomes:

- Design and evaluate computing solutions that solve complex problems
- Apply software engineering principles and best practices throughout the development lifecycle
- Communicate technical concepts effectively through clear documentation
- Use industry-relevant tools and technologies to develop production-ready software

## Reflection
Enhancing this artifact strengthened my understanding of how thoughtful software design directly impacts usability, scalability, and maintainability. It reinforced the importance of planning, refactoring, and documentation as essential components of professional software engineering practice.
