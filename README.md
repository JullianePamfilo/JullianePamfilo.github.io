## Overview

Welcome to my CS 499 Computer Science ePortfolio. This repository represents the culmination of my undergraduate Computer Science program and showcases both my **technical growth** and my **readiness to enter professional software engineering roles**.

The portfolio includes:

- A **professional self-assessment**
- An **informal code review** (video walkthrough)
- **Three enhanced artifacts** demonstrating applied skills in:
  - Software Design & Engineering  
  - Algorithms & Data Structures  
  - Databases  

Each artifact was intentionally revisited, evaluated, and improved to reflect professional standards in software development.

## My Growth as a Software Engineer

When I began the Computer Science program, my primary goal was simple: *make the code work*. As I progressed, my mindset evolved significantly. I began to think less like a student completing assignments and more like an engineer designing systems.

Today, my focus centers on:

- Scalability and performance  
- Maintainable and readable code  
- Clear separation of concerns  
- Defensive programming and validation  
- Designing with real users in mind  

This evolution is reflected across every enhanced artifact in this portfolio.

## Artifact Highlights

### 🧩 Software Design & Engineering

This artifact demonstrates my ability to design **modular, user-centered applications**. I enhanced an existing dashboard project by improving architectural structure, separating responsibilities across components, and emphasizing maintainability.

Key takeaways from this artifact:
- Stronger separation of concerns  
- Clearer component roles  
- Improved usability and extensibility  
- Real-world refactoring of an existing system  

This work reflects a core professional skill: improving and maintaining existing software, not just writing new code.

### ⚙️ Algorithms & Data Structures

This artifact marks a major technical milestone for me. In the enhanced course planner application, I replaced less efficient approaches with **appropriate data structures**—including hash maps and sorted collections—to improve performance and scalability.

Enhancements include:
- Optimized lookup and runtime efficiency  
- Thoughtful data structure selection  
- Input validation and normalization  
- Justification of algorithmic choices  

This artifact demonstrates my ability to reason about complexity, performance tradeoffs, and system efficiency.

### 🗄️ Databases

The databases artifact highlights my practical understanding of **data persistence, CRUD operations, and data integrity**. By enhancing a Python-based database module, I focused on reliability, validation, and clean separation between business logic and data access.

Key improvements:
- Stronger input validation  
- Robust error handling  
- Clear separation of responsibilities  
- Safer, more predictable data interactions  

This artifact reflects my ability to work responsibly with structured data in real-world applications.

## Informal Code Review

In addition to the written artifacts, this portfolio includes an **informal code review video**, where I walk through existing code, identify strengths and weaknesses, and explain the reasoning behind my enhancements.

📺 **Code Review Video:**

This review demonstrates my ability to:
- Read and evaluate existing codebases  
- Communicate technical decisions clearly  
- Reflect on design and implementation choices  

---

## Program Outcomes & Professional Skills

Collectively, these artifacts demonstrate mastery of the CS program outcomes, including:

- Designing and evaluating computing solutions  
- Applying appropriate algorithms and data structures  
- Managing data effectively and securely  
- Communicating technical concepts clearly  

Beyond technical skills, this portfolio also reflects growth in:
- Documentation and technical writing  
- Self-assessment and reflection  
- Professional communication  

---

## Looking Ahead

As I transition into professional software engineering roles, I feel confident in my ability to contribute meaningfully to development teams. I am especially interested in:

- Full-stack development  
- Applied AI systems  
- Scalable, user-focused platforms  

This ePortfolio is not just the end of an academic journey—it is the foundation for continuous learning and professional growth.

---

## Final Reflection

The work presented here reflects my readiness to enter the field as a software engineer who:

- Designs with intention  
- Implements with efficiency  
- Communicates with clarity  
- Continuously seeks improvement  

Thank you for taking the time to explore my work.
