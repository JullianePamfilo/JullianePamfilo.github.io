    <h3>Professional Self-Assessment</h3>

    <p>
      Throughout the Computer Science program, I evolved from focusing primarily
      on making programs function correctly to designing systems that emphasize
      scalability, maintainability, performance, and security. This ePortfolio
      represents that growth through intentionally enhanced artifacts and
      reflective documentation.
    </p>

    <p>
      My coursework strengthened my ability to collaborate in technical
      environments, communicate complex concepts clearly, and apply appropriate
      data structures, algorithms, and architectural patterns to real-world
      problems. I consistently revisited prior work to refactor designs,
      optimize performance, and improve validation and error handling.
    </p>

    <p>
      The artifacts presented below collectively demonstrate my proficiency in
      software design and engineering, algorithmic reasoning, and database
      systems. Together, they reflect my readiness to contribute to professional
      development teams and continue growing as a software engineer.

    <h3>Informal Code Review</h3>

    <p>
      This video presents an informal code review completed during Module Two of
      CS 499. I walk through the existing functionality of the selected artifact,
      identify opportunities for improvement, and explain the planned
      enhancements aligned with the program outcomes.
